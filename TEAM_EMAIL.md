Subject: Direct Mail Landing Pages Ready for Review

Hi Team,

The direct mail landing pages are complete and ready for review. Here are the live links:

City-Specific Landing Pages:
- El Cerrito: https://requirements-for-city-direct-mail-c.vercel.app/el-cerrito.html
- Oakland: https://requirements-for-city-direct-mail-c.vercel.app/oakland.html  
- Oxnard: https://requirements-for-city-direct-mail-c.vercel.app/oxnard.html
- Generic/California: https://requirements-for-city-direct-mail-c.vercel.app/generic.html

What's Done:
- All 4 landing pages with city-specific branding and images
- DrBalcony colors and professional government design
- Webinar-focused content with SB-721/SB-326 compliance info
- City-specific urgency messages
- Mobile-responsive design
- UTM tracking setup

What Needs Tech Team:
The forms are currently placeholder (they show an alert when submitted). We need the tech team to build a WordPress form that can be embedded into these pages. The form needs:
- Name (required)
- Email (required) 
- Phone (optional)
- City field (hidden, auto-populated)
- UTM tracking fields (hidden)

Next Steps:
1. Please review the pages and let me know if any changes are needed
2. Tech team can work on the WordPress form integration
3. Once forms are ready, we can replace the placeholder forms

The pages are ready to go live once the forms are connected. QR codes will be generated by the direct mail vendor.

Let me know your thoughts!

Thanks,
George
